I quit my job. I did it for personal reasons.

After a day or two of feeling a little bit lost, I realise now that this is an opportunity to play with some technologies I've wanted to sink my teeth into for a long time. So, I got real excited about all the things I would now have time to work on.

Then it started to look like a bit mountain of work I was making for myself.

In order to appear just a _little_ more organised, I'm going to put together an action plan, in a list, with some bits and pieces I want to do. A bucket list of learning, I guess you could call it, so that my day to day activities don't devolve into mindlessly scrolling reddit and binging steam games.
